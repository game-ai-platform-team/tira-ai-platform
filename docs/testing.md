# Testing

Right now, testing is divided between frontend and backend.

## Backend

First, you need to go into backend folder and install dependencies.
To test backend, run `pytest`.
To make a test coverage report, run `coverage run --branch -m pytest` and then `coverage html`.

## Frontend

First, you need to go into frontend folder and install dependencies.
To run frontend tests, run `npm test`
